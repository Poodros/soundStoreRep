# soundStoreRep

Hi Tom, its me, Daniel. Again. I was on your C++ Class and your JS class. Thanks for the chance you gave me to resubmit assignment 2. 
While right now, or...whenever you're checking this repo, depending on how lucky I get, the whole thing looks like a mess and CRUD isn't really working well and still have the authentication to work on
Rest assured im still working on it :)

Thank you for believing in me
